## Create a tree representation of the ISLA Algorithm
- Given r, generate the r - 1 quadratic equations

## Create a method to calculate the number of total paths in the tree for each length (r = 3,5,7...)

## Create a DFS function that finds the solution

## Observe the solutions for small variables of r (e.g., r = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13) and clarify termination criterion
